## 📄 Objectives

This project is created during the **Alura + Oracle Next Education** to practice skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project applied concepts of semantics, best practices, style and responsivity using CSS and JavaScript.

## Requirements:

1. The codification keys used are the following:

- The letter "a" must be replaced by "ai";
- The letter "e" must be replaced by "enter";
- The letter "i" must be replaced by "imes";
- The letter "o" must be replaced by "ober";
- The letter "u" must be replaced by "ufat".

2. Must accept only small letters.
3. Must not accept special characters and letters with accents.
4. Must let the user encrypt and decrypt text.

- Eg:

```
"gato" => "gaitober"
"gaitober" => "gato"
```

5. The page must have fields for inserting the text to be encrypted or decrypted, and the user must be able to choose between the two options.
6. The result should be displayed on the screen.

## Extras:

- [ ] A button that copies the encrypted/decrypted text to the clipboard - that is, that has the same functionality as ctrl+C or the "copy" option in the application menu.
